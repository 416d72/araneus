Here are things that I learnt through out making this app
-
- Structuring files.
- Choosing the right license.
- Unit tests.
- Automating tests.
- Using `try` and `except` to facilitate tests.
- Embedding shortcuts in QT designer app templates.
- Embedding image in qt templates.
- Handling `.json` files.
- Creating `.ini` files for saving configurations and validating them.
- Copying files with their permissions.
- Executing system commands with `os.system()`.
- Checking what OS is currently running.
- Allowing only one instance by creating a `.pid` file.
- `lambda`, `with`, `if __name__ == "__main__"`
